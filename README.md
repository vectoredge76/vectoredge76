- 👋 Hi, We @vectoredge are working on standardizing Authorizations or Access Rights Management for Enterprise Applications
- 👀 We are interested in folks who believe Authorization is most critical problem being faced by Enterprise owing to its complexity 
due to lack of Standarization and Assurance, today most of the Enterprise Application only ensure Authorizations, and care more 
for Authenication and give less importance to Securing Authorizations. This leads to problem of Excessive permission sprawl,misconfigurations, 
offboarding aka revocation and visibility across enterprise digital perimeter.

- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate with likeminded people or communities who believe this problem requires due attention 
and can help us carve out solution for that.

- 📫 We can be reached at connect@vectoredge.io or lokesh@vectoredge.io
